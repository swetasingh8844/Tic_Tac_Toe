# Tic_Tac_Toe

## Description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If the grid is filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
